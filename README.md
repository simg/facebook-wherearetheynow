# facebook-wherearetheynow
Facebook API client that can shows where in the world your friends are now.

Allows dynamic filtering of friends based on their interests, sex, friend list - all based on their permissions of course.

Featured an innovative "taxonomy drop down" selector that looked like a standard select box but allowed drill down into a Facebook based taxonomy.

Status: Facebook pulled the plug on the API features the app needs. Much disappoint.

Support: None

TODO:
  refactor code
  split config into seperate file for convenient source control
  automated build / minify
