  <h2 style="clear:both; padding-top:25px;">Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>Simply put, I don't collect, store or look at any information about you or your friends through the use of this app.
  Use of this app is completely private and (almost) completely anonymous.</p>
  <p>The permissions you grant allow enable the filtering mechanism that can hide or show your friends based on their details. 
  All of the data is only transferred between your Facebook and your web browser. When you stop using the app the data is deleted from your browser (it remains on Facebook). </p>
  <p>I do currently log your user name to Google Analytics so that I can track how many people are using the App. 
  I don't track anything other than you have opened the app. Whatever you do with the app is completely private and will always remain so.</p>
  <p>I do not request any permissions that would allow me to edit your Facebook details, or post to your wall or anything horrible
  like that. I treat your privacy with as much, or more, respect than I would my own.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,<br /><br /><br />
  Simon Gardner<br />
